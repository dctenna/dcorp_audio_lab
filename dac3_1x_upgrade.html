        <p>In scope of this progect three things were covered. First of all XMOS transport was 
        used as input stage. Second – proper shift register was added. So both left and right chanel 
        samples would reach DAC chip simultaneously. And last but not least option – the PCB was 
        designed to minimize traces length and spread spectrum.</p>

        <p>Additional board is placed directly above DAC original board to minimize length of connection
        wires too.</p>
